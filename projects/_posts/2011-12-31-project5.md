We want to create an iPhone App that maps the location of the so called "Stolpersteine". The aim of our computing is to simplify the locating of the stones and to enable users to find details of each individual victim by linking up with Wikipedia or other digital databases. Our intention is to support the founders of the Stolpersteine Initiative to commemorate the innocent victims of the holocaust with the introduction of our app.
