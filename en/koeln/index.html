At the moment we are working on a fine dust measuring device for mobile measurements of (to createa) children's playground information app for Cologne's schools and students.

Of course, there are also issues that cannot be realized in the short term, such as the disclosure of KVB. An app that shows the defibrillator in the vicinity of one's own environment is ready. Also, the Wasserqualit√§tsApp from Heilbronn for Cologne has been redeployed.
