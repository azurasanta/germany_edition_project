Coding, designing, writing, into politics or maybe just intested? One or more of these terms caught your attention? Perfect!

Welcome to Code for Ruhrgebiet! We're an OpenKnowledge Lab in the Ruhr area of North Rhine-Westphalia. Our passion is to introduce the beauty of open data and transparency to local institutions and governments.

_**Sounds exciting?**_

**Great!** You can join us by signing up to <a href="https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/codeforruhrgebiet" target="_blank">our Mailinglist</a>. We meet once a month - usually on the first Thursday of the month. You can find all the dates <a href="http://meetu.ps/c/2DcsQ/rnrpY/f" target="_blank">on Meetup</a>.

Let's make our world more accessible and show everyone the power of transparency!

_Oh and don't worry: we also speak English! Any questions? Write us an email._
