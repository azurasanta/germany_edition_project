Welcome to our OK Lab in Potsdam!

Since Open Data Day 2016 we gather every second Tuesday. Furthermore, we organize the annual open data barcamp <a href="http://potsdam.io">potsdam.io</a> in November. 

We aim to accompany the evolution around open data in Brandenburg politically and of course with software projects. Feel free to join our lab and support us. Get in touch with us via email, OKF Slack instance, GitHub or personally at the <a href="https://machbar-potsdam.de" target="blank">machBar</a> (Friedrich-Engels-Str. 22) close to Potsdam's main train station. Find our next dates on <a href="http://meetup.com/OK-Lab-Potsdam">Meetup</a>. Don't hessiate to get in touch if you have any questions.
