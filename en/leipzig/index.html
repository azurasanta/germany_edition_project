Women are invited to come and support us. We appreciate any helping hands, whether design, code, PR, etc. The OK lab Leipzig meets every Monday at 19:00 at the BIC, to work together on open data apps for Leipzig. Newcomers and people who do not program are always welcome! An input session takes place on the second Monday of every month. On this day, we invite external speakers, introduce technologies and concepts or work together across the project.
