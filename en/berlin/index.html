Welcome to the Berlin OK Lab! We are about 30 people working in various groups on projects around open data and civic tech. We all come from different areas, so the projects on which we work are very diverse.

We meet every Monday at 19.00 (mostly at Wikimedia, Tempelhofer Ufer 23 - please check Meetup) to work on our projects. On the 2nd Monday of the month, we also host an idea round to show event participants our previous projects and new ideas and projects that can be contributed to. If this has sparked your interest, feel free to swing by one of our intro meetings.
