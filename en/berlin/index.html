Welcome to the Berlin OK lab!  We  are  about 30 people working in various groups on projects  around  open data and civic tech.  We  come  from  all  different  areas, so the projects  in which we work on are very diverse.

We meet every  Monday at 19.00 O'clock  at Wikimedia ( Tempelhofer  Ufer 23) to work on our  projects. On the 2nd  Monday of the month,  we also host an idea round  to show event participants  our previous projects and new  ideas and projects that can be contributed to. If this has sparked your interest, feel free to swing by one of our intro meetings.
