"Servus" and welcome at the OK Lab in Munich! We are a group that is actively engaged in open data and civic hacking, to make Munich even nicer digitally. We are always interested in new people with ideas.

On the 21st of February 2015, Open Data Day takes place all over the world. We will host our own hackathon, along with the city of Munich. All details are available on our Hackathon page.
