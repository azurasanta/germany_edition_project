We are  a  group of open data  enthusiasts  in  Ulm. Our target  is   to open various data sets  under  open  licenses  together to  get  then via API for  third-party applications  available  to  do and to built great      applications .  We  meet  up  every  two  weeks on Tuesdays  at the University of Ulm and hold regular hackathons and barcamps .
